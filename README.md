# ENER_104_Renewable_Energy

## Project 1 : 

### Introduction

The project brief for this project stated that we make an *Inspiration Presentation* on any topic that inspires us in the field of *Renewable Energy* and present it in the inital five minutes of the seminar. So I came across an Al-Jazeera article that mentioned the opening of a floating solar power plant in Indonesia known as the Cirata Floating Powerplant . This was a fairly new concept for me. The articel was quite interesting that I immediately started exploring this topic it further and made the decision that I will discuss the feasibility of such powerplant in Pakistan as my inspiration presentation. So here it is :)

### Key Learnings

-  This was a new topic for my classmates as well. One thing that I missed mentioning in the presentation was the affect on the aquatic life like fish, plankton, algae, and other organisms in the reservoir. So the general research on floating photovoltaics in reservoirs indicates low overall risk to aquatic ecosystems when coverage is not too dense.  The shading does prevent some sunlight from reaching under the panels. However, in a deep reservoir like Cirata, light already diminishes with depth and uncovered areas allow normal penetration elsewhere.
